My name is Aziz Alangari (AR: عبدالعزيز العنقري)

My career has sprawned into areas of Tech to Entertainment to Crypto. 

My first job out of college was doing marketing for Uber pre-IPO. I then worked in Hollywood to pursue a career in screenwriting. As a sophomore in college, I followed my curiosity and purchased my first Bitcoin in 2016.

I now invest in crypto, and work indirectly with the Saudi Central Bank and the Capital Market Authority on the Saudi Web3 ecosystem.

I write a weekly Substack newsletter that discusses online discourse, crypto, and niche Saudi culture. 

I graduated from Riyadh Schools, Chapman University, and Carnegie Mellon.

I'm Saudi born & raised; and spent the majority of my adult life between New York and Los Angeles.

Outside of crypto and writing, I enjoy spending some leisure time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
