My name is Aziz Alangari

I did content for Uber pre-IPO. I briefly worked in Hollywood as a production assistant. During my sophomore year of college, I followed my curiosity and purchased my first Bitcoin in 2016.

In 2022, I <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/aziz-alangari?_gl=1*y8bww*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjU0NDg3NDkzLjE3NTg4MTcwMjM.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*czE3NTg4MTcwMjEkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTg4MTcwMjEkajYwJGwwJGgxMjM5NTAzNTI5">wrote</a> about Social Tokens and Music NFTs on <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/author/aziz-alangari?_gl=1*y8bww*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjU0NDg3NDkzLjE3NTg4MTcwMjM.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*czE3NTg4MTcwMjEkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTg4MTcwMjEkajYwJGwwJGgxMjM5NTAzNTI5">CoinDesk</a> and was in charge of content writing for the largest decentralized storage provider and Layer-1 blockchain, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>. 

I now invest in crypto, and work indirectly with the Saudi Central Bank and the Capital Market Authority on the Saudi Web3 ecosystem.

I write a weekly <a href="https://asease.substack.com">Substack</a> newsletter that discusses online discourse, crypto, and niche Saudi culture. Unconventionally, I have an active 
<a href="https://tiktok.com/@alan__gari">TikTok</a> account which I receive a lot of joy from.

I graduated from Riyadh Schools, Chapman University, and Carnegie Mellon.

I'm Saudi born & raised; and spent the majority of my adult life between New York and Los Angeles.

Outside of crypto and writing, I enjoy spending some leisure time in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
